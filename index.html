		<h3>What is Chum Kune Do?</h3>
		<p>Chum Kune Do is a Eurasian Martial Art, founded by <a alt="Profile of Chum Kune Do's founder Shizu Clifford Hyde-Gomes" href="profile-shizu.php">Master Clifford Hyde-Gomes</a>. Chum Kune Do is also known for awakening of knowledge. The fighting method is taken from the streets and was created by shizu Clifford for the 21st century.</p>
		<p>We train on soft mats. Few dojos (places where we train) are not permanently matted, so putting the mats out is usually part of the 	warm-up. After everyone is on the mat, we use the traditional Eurasian way of greeting, bow. Then the warm-up begins.</p>
		<h3>The warm-up</h3>
		<p>Normally taken by an experienced grade (person with a coloured belt) or the instructor, the objective to get muscles warm and working efficiently, and prevent strains and other injuries that can be caused by cold joints and muscles. The warm-up combines aerobic/cardiovascular exercise designed to get the heart-rate up with stretches specific to the muscles used in Chum Kune Do. It normally lasts about 20 to 30 minutes. You can expect to be sweating at the end of the warm-up, but not completely exhausted.</p>
		<h3>Break fall</h3>
		<p>It is usual for the session to start (after the warm-up) with break falling - this is where you learn how to fall over without hurting yourself. It is always tailored to your level of ability, and as with everything in a Chum Kune Do session, you will never be asked to do something which is too dangerous for you to do give your level of skill. You'll begin by learning to fall from a kneeling position. Leaping over small buildings comes much later on in your career or training</p>
		<h3>The rest of the session</h3>
		<p>The rest of the session will be structured according to what the instructor wishes to teach on that day. It is quite common for sessions to begin with everyone training together, then the lower grades train separately from the higher grades so that techniques more appropriate for individual skill levels can be taught.</p>
		<p>Chum Kune Do is made up of techniques which fall broadly into the following categories:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Kung Fu, forms</li>
			<li>Throws</li>
			<li>Joint locks</li>
			<li>Boxing, Strikes &amp; Kicking (Sparing)</li>
			<li>Strategy</li>
			<li>Ground-fighting</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These techniques are rarely taught in isolation as Chum Kune Do is all about being able to combine many techniques effectively. For beginners, it would be normal to learn (for example) a throw, a strike and a joint lock at the same time, while higher grades will have the opportunity of concentrating on strikes, locks and throws whilst learning strategies for dealing with multiple simultaneous attackers - and you thought the warm-up made you sweat!</p>
		<p>Throwing is the thing that makes many people think that training at Chum Kune Do must be painful, but we really are careful - all that break falling you do at the start of each session is designed specifically to make sure the throws don't hurt. Because most fights end up with both people on the floor, we spend a fair amount of time learning how to control and restrain a person on the floor - these techniques range from the traditional Judo, Jitsu &amp; Aikido hold-downs through to more modern techniques.</p>
		<h3>Weapons</h3>
		<p>The first weapons you learn to defend yourself from are fists and feet, but as you progress different weapons are introduced - beginning with things like plastic bottles (which don't hurt when you mess it up) and working up to things like baseball bats (which do hurt!). As with everything in Chum Kune Do, you will not be asked to defend against something if you do not have the skill to do so safely. Our Self-defence is techniques hidden in our Forms.</p>
		<h3>Rounding up</h3>
		<p>At the end of the session, after a warm-down and again we end by saying goodbye with the traditional Eurasian bow. Then it's time to leave the mat (and usually put the mats away) before heading off home.</p>
