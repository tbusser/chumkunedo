			<p>CKD is about more than just attack and defence. The lessons learnt including the mind set that is developed can be applied to help you in many other aspects unrelated to martial arts, whether they are physical or mental. CKD is a system that is tailored to what works for you, you learn it all stand up and groundwork, but can focus on the techniques that fit your physique and attitude. Its fun, it's practical and it's rewarding.</p>

			<p>Its been a while since ive spoken to you but wanted to let you know that your classes really helped me. A few weeks ago I was talking to a group of YPs at work having just finsihed taking the lesson when a YP decided for what ever reason I do not know but he put me in a choker hold, not as tight as last time but enough. I really couldn't tell you how or what I did but the next thing he and I knew was that his arm was up his back and his hand touching his shoulder, this boy is about 6-1, he proceeded to bend himself onto a table to stop me from breaking his arm which I have to say I really did want to do but didnt and all with just my left hand. I proceeded to tell him never to touch me again in a very controlled manner and then released him. He said sorry about 20 mins later. I said you were really lucky as I wanted to break your arm and he said I know. So after a few wobblerly days I went back on the landings again. Confidence restored to almost my former glory. Thank you as I feel sure that it was your classes helped me to achieve this.</p>
