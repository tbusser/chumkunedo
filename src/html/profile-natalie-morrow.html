			<p>This page features students who have attained Unique Achievement; coping with everyday trials of health &amp; well being these students have achieved much while under extra duress.</p>
			<p>A Dojo story I once heard goes like this:</p>
			<p>Student: Teacher, I have trained for five years now, and because of my illness and learning
			difficulties I am only now a green Sash when all of my friends are black Sash. I have come to
			your lessons every time without fail when some of them have not, and I still cannot keep up
			with them. How can I continue when I am so far behind?</p>
			<p>Teacher: Your friends are able-bodies and free of learning difficulties, they have reached
			the level expected of them. You however, have continued to see your way through you problem
			and have overcome many obstacles then they, exceeding by far what was required by you. You
			have achieved all that your friends have and much more.</p>

			<p>My name is Natalie Morrow, I am 24 years old, and this is a photo of myself taken
			outside St Augustine school where I train in Chum Kune do.</p>
			<p>I have been doing Chum Kune do martial arts for about two years now, when I first
			started I was very shy but now I really enjoy it so much and have made so many friends.</p>
			<p>I am now a yellow sash, since being here I have got an Academy award for progressing in
			Chum Kune Do and a certificate for the grade of yellow sash, and though I do martial arts
			on Saturday afternoon, I also have other interest during the week.</p>
			<p>It doesn't mater if you get stuck on anything in the class because the students are so
			helpful, so even if you are a new or old student you get all the help you need.</p>
			<p>I have learnt so much by being here but there are times when I do need help as I am a
			slow learner and it did take me a while to get my yellow sash.</p>
			<p>But I am very proud of it and what I have achieved since I have been here; I have recently
			acquired some boxing gloves so now I am sparring as well.</p>
			<p>I would like to thank Master Clifford &amp; all the Instructors and my fellow martial arts
			students for helping me along in Chum Kune Do.</p>
			<p>THANK YOU</p>
