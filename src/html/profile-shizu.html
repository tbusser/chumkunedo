			<p class="middle" style="color:red" ><strong>This page is dedicated to my Father, for making me the man I am in the Martial Arts World today. I thank my Father for this. </strong></p>
			<img class="floatRight profileImage" src="images/chum-profile.jpg" alt="Shizu Clifford" title="Shizu Clifford" />
			<p>I started training in 1958. In 1959 my Father taught me boxing, as he was all India Boxing champion for many years. In his absence my elder brother Gerry would teach me, as my Father would be away from home due to this work. At the age of 9 years old I was enrolled into Kalari (the mother of all martial arts from India). I didn't want to go for my training, being unfit, lazy and always getting beaten. However, my Father pushed me into it and my family supported me all the way!</p>
			<p>At the age of 16, I took up Kickboxing, then Jutsu-Ruy, while still training in Kickboxing. At 17 I took the silver medal in the Asian games.</p>
			<p>I stopped training for 8 years due to the civil war where schools were burnt, or closed down.</p>
			<p>This training took place in East Pakistan and India. Because of my martial arts background I have been able to get better jobs. I have worked for the United Nation Merchant Navy as a Radio Operator, then in the British High Commission in Dhaka Bangladesh as a Security/Interpreter. I have also worked, as and when, as a Body guard to British Diplomats.</p>
			<p>I came to England in 1978 and soon earned a fierce reputation in North and Central London. Not in tournaments but on the streets, as I was picked on regularly and ended up in a street fight.</p>
			<p>After moving to Rainham, Kent in 1985, my martial arts skills soon became known. I have worked as a doorman for night clubs in London, Maidstone and Gillingham.</p>
			<p>As everybody was doing some form of martial arts, I needed to create a martial art for the 21st century, which I did. It is call Chum Kune Do and it uses all the martial arts knowledge I have trained in.</p>
			<p>The last Tournament I had entered was the world championship in Germany in 2004.</p>

			<p>In 1990 I opened my Chum Kune Do Martial Arts Academy in Rainham, Kent.</p>
			<p>I received my First Ever UK Hall Of Fame in 1998.</p>
			<p>Then in 1999, I received my 35 years Merit Award Hall of Fame. I have been presented with my Masters Degree in Chum Kune Do and my Master Instructor Hall of Fame was awarded to me by the World United Martial Arts Federation.</p>

			<p>I have coached my students from Inter-school, County, British and International level to become World Champions in Kung Fu, Karate, Kickboxing and self-defence in forms and contact fighting.</p>
